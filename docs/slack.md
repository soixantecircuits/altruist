# Slack

## Setup
First get your personal token [here](https://api.slack.com/tokens).  
  
In your `settings.json` file, you'll need to add the following configuration object to the `actions` property:

```json
"actions": {
  "slack": {
    "token": "abdc-xyz",
    "channel": "random"
  },
}
```

## Usage

```cURL
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "caption": "hello!",
  "media": "/path/to/my/img.jpg"
}' "http://localhost:36500/api/v1/actions/slack"
```

## Options

|name|type|required|description|
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
|**caption/message**|`string`|&minus;|text message. Required if no media sent|
|**media**|`array`|&minus;|array with the image or video to upload (only works with files with a local path specified) (more infos on sending media [here](/postRequest.md))|

The 'media' option must be one of the following:
 * path to a file on your system (example: `/path/to/image.png`)
 * url (example: `http://some_site.com/image.png`)
 * base64 encoded string

Supported formats are **JPG**, **PNG**, **GIF**, **WEBP** (for images) and **MP4** (for videos)

You can also set `message` and/or `media` into your config directly, if they don't need to be set by the user.

You **have** to provide at least one of the two options (be it in config or in request).
